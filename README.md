Matt Williams' repository for Breakout
Co-developed by James Cunningham (james.cunningham.18@cnu.edu)

## Getting started
Firstly, Python 3.7 is needed for this. If not already installed, [it can be installed here](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-377/). Make sure to choose the option in the installer to include it in the PATH.

To download the files, click the button labelled "Clone or download", and choose "Download ZIP". Once downloaded, extract the files from the File Explorer to the desired location. Then, navigate into the "breakout-master" subdirectory containing Breakout.py using the command line ([a tutorial on navigating the command line](https://www.computerhope.com/issues/chusedos.htm)). Once in the folder containing the file "Breakout.py", enter the following command into the command prompt:

`python Breakout.py`

This should start the game!
